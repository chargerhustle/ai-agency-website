**Recommended workflow:**
1. Set up the core layout (header, footer, main structure) first.
2. Build each landing page section in order (hero, why us, etc.), testing and polishing as you go.
3. Implement blog and contact form logic after the main layout/sections are done.
4. Add SEO, analytics, and legal page before launch.
5. Deploy and do final QA.
